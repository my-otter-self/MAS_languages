good morning dalogue:
Dzień dobry [player]!
Miło mi cię tak wcześnie widzieć, wiesz jak mówią:
"[monika's nickname] z rana jak śmietana!"
Ahahah, sorry [nickname]! I was just saying good morning in Polish.
Now let's start our day together~

Translation of the polish part:
Good morning [player]!
It's nice to see you so early, you know what they say!
(this part is a popular polish saying about stuff in the morning but i has the same essence as 'a day without [...] is a day wasted')
