"Hey, [player]!"
"Would you like to learn a bit of Polish?"
"There's a lot of grammar rules that make this language be hard to learn..."
"But learning languages is always fun!"

"So, would you like to give it a try and learn some basics?{nw}"

    "Not now, [m_name].":
    m "Oh, alright!"
    m "If you ever want to give it a try, make sure to let me know!"
    m "Thanks for listening, [player]~"

    "Yes!":
    m "Yay! I'm glad to hear that, [player]."
    m "Did you know that Nicolaus Copernicus was actually Polish?"
    m "He was born in Toruń, in 1473."
    m "Thanks to him, humanity progressed in the scientific field of astronomy - he was the one to propose a heliocentric system!"
    m "Which claimed that planets orbit around the Sun, and Earth, besides orbiting the Sun annually, also turns once daily on its own axis."
    m "Astronomy is an interesting topic, if you ask me."
    m "But now, let's start the lesson!"
    m "You know how there's a lot of ways to say hello in all languages, and so the same occurs in Polish."
    m "You can say 'cześć', 'witaj' or 'hej' - which is very similiar to the English 'hey'! You even pronounce it the same way."
    m "Those were examples of greeting someone you know, or who is on the same 'rank' as you - you wouldn't greet a policeman or teacher like this."
    m "In situations where you need to remain proffesional, you say 'dzień dobry', which stands for good morning, or 'dobry wieczór', which is good evening."
    m "You could also say 'witam', which is similiar to 'witaj', but no the same."
    m "The difference is 'witam' sounds more as if you personally were greeting the person, and witaj sounds more like a 'hello, you', not 'hello, I'm greeting you'."
    m "...Ahaha, it sure is pretty complicated, huh?"
    m "Thanks for listening!"
