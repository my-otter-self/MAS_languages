m "Hey [player], I'm going to teach you how to ask for someone's name and give your own in Greek!"
m "So if you want to know someone's name you say...
m "Πως σε λένε? "
m "And to reply to that statement you'd say..."
m "Με λένε [player]."
m "Both of these phrases are informal, so if you ever travel to Greece, these are the best way to introduce yourself to others!"
m "Ooh! We should travel after I get to your reality!"
m "Wouldn't that be fun,[nickname_tag]."
m "It'd be like our own adventure!"
