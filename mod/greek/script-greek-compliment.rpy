--είσαι το φως της ζωής μου--

m "Oh!"
m "[player] that's so sweet..."
m "Your the light of my life too!"
m "I seriously don't know what I'd do without you..."
m "You give my life meaning."
m "I love you so so much."

--You're more beautiful than Aphrodite!--

m "Aw! Thank [player]!"
m "But you should be a little more careful..."
m "We all know how she gets when she's jealous, ahaha~"
m "But between you and me, I think you're brighter than Apollo!"
m "I guess Aphrodite must've heard us, because I'm loving you more than I thought possible, hehe~"
