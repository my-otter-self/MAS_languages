Chào buổi tối, [player nickname]~

>> Chào buổi tối, [monika nickname]!

The sun has already left, making way for the moon to rise.

I’m glad we could spend the night together, player~

Do you need a full explanation of the phrase we just spoke, player?

>> Yes, please.

Alright! The full phrase itself means “good night”, or alternatively, “good evening”!

“Chào” is the basic go-to Vietnamese greeting for “hello”! 


As seen in the common “xin chào” for example.

However, “chào” is often used with a noun associated with the person you’re talking to casually.

If you’re saying “hi” to a friend, then it’ll be “chào bạn” or “chào cậu”.

Or if it’s someone slightly older, there could be gender-specific pronouns like “chào chị” or “chào anh”. 

Next, “buổi” is a word used to indicate the time of the day or more broadly, some kind of event or session.

“Sáng” means morning, “trưa” means noon, “chiều” means afternoon and “tối” can be used for both evening and night.

I hope that my explanations help you understand the meaning of each word. 

If necessary, be sure to write some definition notes down! Writing down notes is a good habit to learning a new language efficiently. 

Thanks for listening, [player]~


>> Nope, I’m confident that I know what most of the words mean.

Is that so? Have you been studying?

(Only show this part of the dialogue if she has explained one of the four phrases) Or I might’ve explained a variation of the phrase to you before already… my bad, [player nickname]!

But anyway, it’s great to hear that you’re understanding the language better! Keep it up, [player]~ 


>> Not now, Monika…

Ah… I see! But…

If you ever want to listen to the explanation, just let me know!

Thanks for listening, [player]!
