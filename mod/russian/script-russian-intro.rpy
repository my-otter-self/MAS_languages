hey [player]
do you want to speak russian with me?
it’s a pretty complicated language…
but after all… it’s one of the most beautiful and lyrical language in the whole world!
so… do you want to try it out?

no
oh… it’s alright 
if you ever want to try it out, you can always tell me
thanks for listening~

yes
that’s fantastic, [player]!
there’s so much I can tell you about russian!
did you know that russian is the eight most-spoken language and it’s an official language in 4 countries?
and I’m not even talking about the incredible poetry that russian poets wrote!
and it’s pretty complicated to translate as well!
there are a lot of russian words that are just untranslatable
and English uses some russian words as well!
though… I just realised 
I think it’s going to be hard to learn it, since it’s written in Cyrillic alphabet or even pronunciation
I guess you’ll have to use google translation or any other translators that can help you
ehehe… sorry, [player]
but it’s not like I can do anything!
well… I’m excited for our trip!
let’s do it together, [player/nickname]!
